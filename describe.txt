Dear professor,I am the leader of the team Alpha . Here is our dataset and objectives.

dataset : Using datasets that we built ourselves
    our dataset will be multiple 4-color dot sets that each sets constructed a picture. 
objectives:
    1. build a MLP model to classify the dots and predict the overall shape of the picture
    2. Try to find a universial MLP network to solve the problem above.
